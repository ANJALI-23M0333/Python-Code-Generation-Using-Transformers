# Python-Code-Generation-Using-Transformers

Tensors  are generalizations of a matrix that can be indexed in more than 2 dimensions. Tensors can be created from Python lists with the torch.tensor() function.


Transformer Architecture is a model that uses self-attention that transforms one whole sentence into a single sentence. This is a big shift from how older models work step by step, and it helps overcome the challenges seen in models like RNNs and LSTMs.
